SQL Databases and Queries

##
I am creating different databases, as well as developing unique queries in order to improve my SQL skills. 

Databases Developed:
- An Apparel Company Database, which queries the company's net revenue.
- An Job Information Database, which creates a few databases by sorting keywords, as well as conducting basic statistics of the quantitative values in the data base.
